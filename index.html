Dolphins <i>(Delphinus Delphis)</i> are one of the smartest and most interesting
animals of the sea! These aquatic mammals are scattered in every ocean of the world
except the Arctic and Antarctic. These dolphin populations around the globe are facing 
severe threats due to human pollution of our oceans.
</p>
<p>
The chemicals and toxins from sewage runoff impair the dolphin's immunity system. Common diseases
caused by these toxins are pnuemonia and skin infections. Not only do these chemicals affect the
immunity system, but also their respiratory systems.Oil platforms and steam boats create pollution 
in the air that dolphins breathe.
</p>
<p> As well as chemicals and toxins affecting the well being of these dolphins, physical garbage 
has had lasting impacts on these dolphins such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Floating aluminum cans physically cutting up the outer skin of the dolphins </li>
<li> The plastic wrapping that holds soda cans together often getting stuck on the 
beaks of bottlenose dolphins.
</ul>
